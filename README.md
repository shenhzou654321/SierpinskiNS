SierpinskiNS
============

The Sierpinski gasket in OpenGL using NSOpenGLView. 

This project was primarily used to set up an NSOpenGL project. In order to use this you must have the [OpenGL Math Library (gml)](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.5/index.html). 

I installed glm from homebrew. XCode (in this project) is configured to use the default Homebrew installation location to include these files.
